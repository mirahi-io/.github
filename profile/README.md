BE GOOD, DO GOOD
------------------
People and relationships are our number one priority. We are open and honest, we make decisions that benefit not only us, and we are always ready to help.

Finding the right work-life balance makes us better professionals, better people, and allows us to enjoy everything we do. We take care of ourselves to take care of those around us in the best possible way.


WE THRIVE AS A TEAM
------------------
We are driven by our team spirit and the close collaboration that we have built over the years working together. We lift each other, we give a hand with others' projects, and most importantly: we are there for each other, and that will never change.


DARE THE IMPOSSIBLE
------------------
Entrepreneurship runs in our blood. At Mirahi, there is always room for a new project or idea to be implemented. Nothing stops us from chasing that project, and if it does not work, we'll take our learnings and move on to the next one.


IF YOU TOUCH IT, YOU OWN IT
------------------
Ownership is a must for us. When we engage in a new project or with a new partner or client, we do it all the way. We don't believe in doing our work 'half way': if we start a project, we take it as ours and will deliver the best results we can.


SPEAK UP
------------------
Transparency and open communication are key for our team. Between us, with our clients and anyone we get to work with. All our team members will be honest and share their views and feedback, even when it gets uncomfortable.
